Third-party routing library
One common use case is to use the button to trigger a navigation to a new page. The ButtonBase component provides a property to handle this use case: component. Given that a lot of our interactive components rely on ButtonBase, you should be able to take advantage of it everywhere:

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
import Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';

<Button component={Link} to="/open-collective">
  Link
</Button>
or if you want to avoid properties collisions:

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
import Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';

const MyLink = props => <Link to="/open-collective" {...props} />

<Button component={MyLink}>
  Link
</Button>
Note: Creating MyLink is necessary to prevent unexpected unmounting. You can read more about it in our composition guide.
