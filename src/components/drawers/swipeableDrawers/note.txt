We are using the following set of properties on this documentation website for optimal usability of the component:

iOS is hosted on high-end devices. We can enable the backdrop transition without dropping frames. The performance will be good enough.
iOS has a "swipe to go back" feature that mess with the discovery feature. We have to disable it.
const iOS = process.browser && /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent);
